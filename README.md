# Webscraping Prices
## The plan is simple: 
1. I find things I want to buy online
2. I'm like "wow! this is so expensive!"
3. I never buy the item

So: The goal is to make something that can track prices, and email a notification to me when prices drop! 
I'm starting this with the hope of making it from a Jupyter Notebook -> Flask/React webapp so I can try a bunch of different things at once. It'd be really cool if I could personalize some nice UI/UX :)
